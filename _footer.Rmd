# Methods

RNA-seq counts were generated by [bcbio][] and [bcbioRNASeq][] using [salmon][] [@salmon]. Counts were imported into [R][] using [tximport][] [@tximport] and [DESeq2] [@DESeq2]. Gene annotations were obtained from [Ensembl][]. Plots were generated by [ggplot2][] [@ggplot2]. Heatmaps were generated by [pheatmap][] [@pheatmap].



# R session information {.tabset}

```{r session_info}

devtools::session_info()
mdHeader("`utils::sessionInfo()`", level = 2)
sessionInfo()
mdHeader("YAML params", level = 2)
print(params)
